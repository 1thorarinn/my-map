# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is this?

- I did a project for a client and was necessary to put a map editor for Strapi fully made in React focus on mapbox-gl and mapbo-gl-draw.
- I performed a database able to recover all the values for routes with places and polygons
- This project finish here. Maybe I gonna make some improvements if the client claims for some issue, but I'm shure they don't gonna do this hahahaha... Jus Joking ;)

Was an awsome piece of work, I calculate about 120h for this. But was not pain at all, cause I did another map project before and I loved it!

I hope someone will find help in my code, cause is fully reusable, just if you catch the data structures.
